Hey there! I'm @gaoleiccie

ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my coding playground! I'm here to turn coffee into code and ideas into interactive web experiences.

ðŸŒ± Currently brewing a concoction of HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript ES6, TypeScript, React.js, Next.js, and Node.js. Let's mix things up!

ðŸ’ž Seeking fellow alchemists to collaborate on brewing some digital magic. Let's concoct something extraordinary together!

ðŸ“« Drop me a message via carrier pigeon... or just shoot me an email at your-email@example.com.

ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: he/him

âš¡ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you'll find me practising my air guitar skills or trying to convince my cat to pair programs with me! Let's turn the web into a wild adventure! ðŸš€
